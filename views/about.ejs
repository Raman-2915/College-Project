                Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji, born Tyag Mal on April 1, 1621, in Amritsar, Punjab, was the ninth Sikh Guru (1664–1675) and the youngest son of Guru Hargobind Ji, the sixth Sikh Guru. Renamed Tegh Bahadur ("Brave Sword") after displaying valor in the Battle of Kartarpur (1635), he was a warrior, poet, philosopher, and spiritual leader. He was married to Mata Gujri Ji, and their son, Guru Gobind Singh Ji, became the tenth Sikh Guru. Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji founded Anandpur Sahib and traveled extensively across India, spreading the teachings of Guru Nanak.

                His life was marked by his commitment to Sikh principles, establishing community projects like water wells and langars (community kitchens). He was ordained as Guru on April 16, 1664, after being identified by Bhai Makhan Shah as the true successor amidst 22 claimants in Bakala.

                Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji’s teachings emphasize liberation from attachment, fear, and dependence, advocating strength through truth, worship, sacrifice, and knowledge. His 116 shabads and 15 ragas in the Guru Granth Sahib cover themes like the nature of God, human attachments, sorrow, dignity, service, and deliverance. Notable teachings include:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-lg mb-4">
                <li>"O mother, I have been blessed with the wealth of God’s Name."</li>
                <li>"True realization of the actual nature of this material world, its perishable, transitory and illusory aspects best dawns on a person in suffering."</li>
                <li>"Fear not and frighten not." – A message of courage and compassion.
            </ul>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                His teachings promote religious tolerance, equality, and indifference to both misery and happiness in pursuit of the Almighty.

            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji’s martyrdom in 1675 is a defining moment in Sikh history. During Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb’s reign, forced conversions to Islam were rampant. When Kashmiri Pandits sought his help, Guru Ji challenged Aurangzeb, stating that if he could convert the Guru, others would follow. Refusing to convert or perform miracles, he and his companions—Bhai Mati Das, Bhai Sati Das, and Bhai Dayala—were tortured and executed in Delhi’s Chandni Chowk. Guru Ji was beheaded on November 11, 1675, earning the title "Hind Di Chadar" (Shield of India) for protecting religious freedom.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                His martyrdom inspired the Sikh community, strengthening their resolve against oppression and making human rights central to Sikh identity. Gurdwara Sis Ganj Sahib marks the execution site, and Gurdwara Rakab Ganj Sahib marks the cremation site.

                Despite maintaining the royal trappings of a Guru, including armed attendants, Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji lived an austere and meditative life. He spent long hours in meditation, reflecting his ascetic nature, and avoided conflict when possible, yet remained a skilled warrior trained in swordsmanship and horsemanship. He traveled extensively to spread Sikh teachings, visiting places like Dhaka, Assam, and Bengal, establishing Sikh temples and community initiatives like langars.
